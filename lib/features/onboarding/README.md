# LokaTrack Onboarding Implementation

## Overview

The onboarding screen provides first-time users with an introduction to LokaTrack's key features. It appears only on the first app launch and guides delivery drivers through the app's functionality.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Introduction**: Introduces drivers to LokaTrack with clear, concise information
- **Modern Design**: Uses modern UI elements with fluid animations and transitions
- **One-Time Display**: Only shown on first app launch, stored using SharedPreferences
- **Dynamic Particles**: Background animation that creates a premium experience
- **Adaptive Colors**: Each page has its own color theme that adapts throughout the UI

## Implementation Details

### File Structure

```
lib/features/onboarding/
├── models/
│   └── onboarding_page_model.dart  # Data model for onboarding pages
├── screens/
│   └── onboarding_screen.dart      # Main onboarding UI implementation
├── services/
│   └── onboarding_service.dart     # Manages onboarding completion state
└── widgets/
    ├── animated_button.dart        # Custom animated button
    └── particle_background.dart    # Animated particle background
```

### How It Works

1. The app checks for first-time launch using `OnboardingService`
2. If first launch, it displays the onboarding screens before login
3. Users can navigate through pages or skip directly to the login screen
4. Upon completion, the onboarding status is saved in SharedPreferences

### Integration Points

- **main.dart**: Checks onboarding status during app initialization
- **AuthCheckScreen**: Controls flow between onboarding, login, and home screens

## Customization

### Adding/Editing Pages

To customize the onboarding content, edit the `onboardingPages` list in `onboarding_page_model.dart`:

```dart
final List<OnboardingPageModel> onboardingPages = [
  OnboardingPageModel(
    title: 'Your New Title',
    description: 'Your new description text',
    icon: Icons.your_icon,
    iconColor: Colors.yourColor,
  ),
  // Add more pages as needed
];
```

### Visual Customization

- **Colors**: Update the `_getCurrentPageColor()` method in `onboarding_screen.dart`
- **Animations**: Adjust animation durations and curves in the animation controllers
- **Particles**: Modify particle count and behavior in `particle_background.dart`

## Dependencies

- `smooth_page_indicator`: For the page dots indicator
- `shared_preferences`: For persistent storage of onboarding status
